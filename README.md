# Volkswagen-Simulation
In 2015, it was found that Volkswagen had been cheating on their emissions tests which led to cars polluting up to 40 times the amount of the current EPA standard of NOx (oxides of nitrogen) once out of the factory. This simulation was created by Daemon 41 of the Spring 2016 CS4500 class to display emissions outputs for lab tests and road tests for the Volkswagen Jetta and Volkswagen Passat.
